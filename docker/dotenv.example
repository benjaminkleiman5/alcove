#schedule = "DAYS(N);[HH:MM]"
#  DAYS
#     A comma separated list of values representing the days of the week on which
#     to perform a backup (valid values are 0-6). Ranges are also allowed e.g. 1-5
#     is Monday through Friday
#   N
#     The number of backups to keep
#   + Any number of schedules can be defined, separated by a single pipe (|)
#     Ex] DAYS1(7)|DAYS2(4)|...
#
# TIME
#   HH:MM
#     The time to initiate the backup (if possible). Seconds cannot be specified.
#
# The SCHEDULE and TIME must be separated by a single semi-colon (;)
# The entire string must be surrounded with quotes ("")
# Ex] Backup every day at 3AM, keep 7 copies
#   schedule="0,1,2,3,4,5,6(7);[03:00]"
# Ex] Backup every Monday at 1AM, keep 4 copies
#   schedule="1(4);[01:00]"
